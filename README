Image Edge Detection Algorithm using Grey Prediction Model

Grey Prediction Model is a time series prediction methodology. This algorithm makes use of the characteristics of a prediction strategy, i.e., the error is more if the difference between the prediction and the actual value is high.

This model is applied to images in the following way:
	1. Given an image, a window of particular size is considered for every pixel.
	2. We consider all the pixels except the center pixel and form a vector. This is analogous to a time series.
	3. Using these pixels, the center pixel is predicted.
	4. Since the prediction is usually similar to the background pixels, if the center pixel belongs to edge, the difference between the prediction and the actual center pixel value is more.
	5. Later on, thresholding gives the edges detected in the given image.
